    description: `Decent course. I had a refresher and learned
    a bunch. However, it is alot more Backend focused than expected.
    More Frontend to balance it would have been great. That's why I did the
    Scrimba React course.`

    description: `So first day, there I was looking up, hoping I instantly make that ONE friend,
    Wachira came through, bless!
    Immediately went back to  mine after class for a round of shisha (haha).
    On the way back, I asked him... "So what are we aiming to graduate with?"
    We did the fist bump on the distinction. Fast forward to December, my Machine Vision
    lecturer had told me that he was worried about me because I asked an easy / silly question.
    Then I went on to subsequently fail his first coursework. I literally went to my course
    director to arrange a way I can drop out whilst cutting my losses. But wow, check out that grade now.
    Let me know if you want to find out how we made it. Its funny!`

    description: `Boarding School - Crucial stage of my life, here I had to make decisions about who I am,
    who I wanted to be and how I wanted to govern my life. Had the pleasure of meeting and being friends with
    some really great people and the displeasure of meeting some horible ones. This was six years of living
    in constant anticipation of getting badly beat by seniors or teachers.
    On the flip side, everything I learnt here, especially through islam, has truly saved and made me in many ways.`
